**tl;dr - This post explains how I built
[LoginWithHN.com (LWHN)](https://loginwithhn.com), an unofficial OAuth2+OpenID
connect provider for [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com). LWHN is for
builders who want to share things with the HN audience, and cuts down friction
like any other OAuth2+OpenID connect provider. LWHN is now open to the public
for new client app registration, so check it out if you're interested.**

_DISCLAIMER: I wrote this article with the knowledge that
[Ory](https://www.ory.sh/) would share it later on their blog/marketing
channels. Ory's product [Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra) powers LWHN's
OAuth2+OpenID Connect integration and I wholeheartedly endorse it._

## Login flows - How/When/What do?

Login is often one of the last things I think about while building a new
project. I've built the email + password flow so many times now that I can do it
in my sleep:

- Salted
  [`bcrypt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)/[`scrypt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)/etc
  password hashes with high work (round) count
- Email reset
- `HTTPOnly` + `Secure` cookies with expiry
- reasonable expiry length

Most people would use a framework like Rails or Django here to save themselves
the time but that's not my style (see rest of this blog).

Anyway, instead of doing too much, one thing I don't do _enough_ of is thinking
about login from a **user-centric point of view**. Case in point - **no one
cares how secure your login is, they care that it's convenient**.

It's a fine line - don't build insecure software (users don't like apps that
leak all their data), but also don't bombard users with friction.

**The right question is what kind of login flow will ~~spark joy~~ be least
annoying for your users**.

## Google? Twitter? Facebook? The community I want to build for is HackerNews

I build a lot of projects/products with people who surf
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) in mind - it's one of the best
moderated high traffic tech communities out there, full of people who are
willing to be early adopters of projects and ideas.

The secret is probably some combination of HN's stellar moderation team and
maybe the focus/industry and the people it attracts. I'm not smart enough to
understand completely _why_ HN is so good, but one thing I know is that I rate
the random seasoned HN user's opinion over a lot of the rest of the internet,
even when
[most commenters on a topic are completely, hilariously wrong](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863),
and routinely condescending/nitpicky.

The mix of early adopters, people with fresh ideas (and many dragging around
many stale-but-good ideas like [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) and
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)), is often the right people to pan rough
drafts of ideas and apps.

## How do people do easier login these days?

Anyway, getting back to the task at hand - these days login has been
federated/distributed for most social/non-social apps, thanks to a few different
frameworks:

- [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
- [Central Authentication Service (CAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service))
  - A bit different as authentication is centralized (it's in the name!), but
    there are some federation features built in to later versions of the
    protocol
  - CAS is my personal favorite; v1 is simplest delegated Authentication
    ("AuthN") you'll find, so simple that I actually did write a
    [small CAS v1 implementation](https://github.com/t3hmrman/casgo)) a while
    ago
- [OAuth2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0) +
  [OpenID Connect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)>)
  - OAuth2 actually is an Authorization ("AuthZ") protocol; you only know what
    someone can do as a given user, not that they _are_ a given user.
  - OpenID Connect builds on OAuth2 to make it an AuthN protocol, by adding and
    endpoint that answers the "who are you" question (`/openid`)

**People are getting _very simple_ login flows by just dropping "Login with
Google" or "Login with Twitter" buttons on their pages!** That's something I'd
love when building products for HackerNews.

Well, this is a short writeup on how I built
[LoginWithHN](https://loginwithhn.com) (Spoiler alert: it's possible, and
actually kind of an easy hack).

## Step one: How much can I stretch OAuth2/OpenID Connect? (RTFM)

As usual, it's good to
[Read The Fucking Manual (RTFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) -- first I
needed to make sure that it _makes sense_ to attempt to do what I'm trying to
do. Simple questions:

- Does the login method _have_ to be a password?
- What are timelines like on token exchange?
- How hard would this be to implement?
- What technologies is most used for cross-site auth?

If you're not an OAuth expert, try to read at least some of the guides on
delegated AuthN/AuthZ below. I recommend starting with CAS, as it's the simplest
and they all work very similarly.

- [CAS Protocol v1 (Yale docs)](https://developers.yale.edu/cas-central-authentication-service)
- [CAS Protocol v1/2/3](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.2.x/protocol/CAS-Protocol-Specification.html)
  - I personally didn't need a lot of the things in v2 & v3 but maybe someone
    did.
- [OAuth 2.0 simplified by OAuth.net](https://oauth.net/getting-started/)
- [OAuth2 Concept guide by Ory](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/oauth2/)
- [An introduction to OAuth 2 by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
- [An illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc)
- [OpenID Connect documentation](https://openid.net/connect/)
- [Beginner's Guide to SAML by Okta](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Beginner-s-Guide-to-SAML?language=en_US)
- [The Beer Drinker's Guide to SAML by Duo Security](https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml)

After reading links above (or not) hopefully you come to the same conclusions I
did:

OAuth2 + OpenIDConnect is the obvious answer here - there's no requirement for
the login credentials to be a username/password (that'd be silly), a username
and password for (OAuth2 at least)

## Step two: How should I do it?

### The ground-floor setup

At this point I have a pretty set stack for the projects I want to build fast,
and it looks like this:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com)
  - This might look like a head scratcher, but I find that `express` is actually
    _too_ loose, most of the time -- I always end up writing in some sort of
    component system which manages lifecycle. NestJS is the best mix of
    pragmatism and "enterprise" application creature comforts that I've seen so
    far.

Obviously, the real question here is what should I use to provide the dynamic
OIDC part of my flow? At first I chose
[`panva/node-oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider). The
documentation is thorough but unfortunately the onboarding just _wasn't easy
enough_ for me.

### First try: NestJS w/ `panva/node-oidc-provider`

Unfortunately `node-oidc-provider` had no ready-to-use Postgres DB adapter -
there's a
[rough edge example](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/7d6b195424c539a8341e665aeabcaf50e7b5ab9a/example/adapters/contributed/sequelize.js),
but the more I read the documentation, and the more I implemented the surface of
the API you needed to slot in the more I was convinced that it was just... too
hard.

A couple things went distinctively wrong:

- Integrating `node-oidc-provider` with NestJS was more difficult than I
  expected (everything's just a `(req, res) => void` right? in the end it better
  to use a `Controller` rather than a NestJS `Middleware`)
- Replicating the schema (so I could enshrine it in the database) of
  `node-oidc-provider` revealed a
  semi-[attribute-value style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-value_system)
  layout

**This project actually sat on the shelf for _6 months_ during this time**, as I
had more important fish to fry - thinking about it was a constant source of
discontent. Funnily enough, I gave up just when I had figured everything out -
and I had just written a glorious DB adapter that actually worked like I wanted
it to:

}
```

</details>

The pain of having to figure out every single one of those enums & classes
(`OIDCGrant`, `OIDCProviderModelID`), write the appropriate DB entities, and do
the checks in a way that made sense to me, made me think: **"why am I even using
this library if I have to get this much into the weeds?"**

I'm just too lazy to do this much work (to be fair I already did it but we'll
ignore that).

Luckily for me I'd seen Ory and their extensive toolset before, and was able to
recall one of their solutions that would help --
[Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra).

### Second time's the charm: NestJS + Ory Hydra

Ory's got a lot of tools with interesting names, and it's often hard to remember
what they do, but [Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra) is the one in the
toolbelt that makes OAuth2+OpenID Connect flows a breeze (and I can confirm they
do!). They've got an excellent
[documentation site](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs), the codebase is written in
Golang (quite possibly the easiest to understand compiled language out there),
and more importantly, **they promise to take the complexity _out_ of managing
the OAuth2 flow**.

I don't manage any fo the grants revocation, etc, Hydra does the work for me.

#### Installing & running Ory Hydra

Since Ory knows just how to appeal to developers, Hydra is a cinch to run
locally with the
[`oryd/hydra` Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/hydra):

```makefile
hydra-local:
    @echo -e "Running local hydra...\n\n"
    $(DOCKER) run --rm \
        -it \
        --network host \
        -p 0.0.0.0:${HYDRA_PUBLIC_PORT}:${HYDRA_PUBLIC_PORT} \
        -p 0.0.0.0:${HYDRA_ADMIN_PORT}:${HYDRA_ADMIN_PORT} \
        --name ${HYDRA_CONTAINER_NAME} \
        -e DSN="${HYDRA_DSN}" \
        -e WEBFINGER_OIDC_DISCOVERY_SUPPORTED_CLAIMS=${HYDRA_WEBFINGER_OIDC_DISCOVERY_SUPPORTED_CLAIMS} \
        -e URLS_LOGIN=${HYDRA_URLS_LOGIN} \
        -e URLS_CONSENT=${HYDRA_URLS_CONSENT} \
        -e URLS_LOGOUT=${HYDRA_URLS_LOGOUT} \
        -e URLS_ERROR=${HYDRA_URLS_ERROR} \
        -e URLS_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT=${HYDRA_URLS_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT} \
        -e URLS_SELF_PUBLIC=${HYDRA_URLS_SELF_PUBLIC} \
        -e URLS_SELF_ISSUER=${HYDRA_URLS_SELF_ISSUER} \
        -e OAUTH2_ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_CLAIMS=${HYDRA_OAUTH2_ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_CLAIMS} \
        -e OAUTH2_HASHERS_BCRYPT_COST=${HYDRA_OAUTH2_HASHERS_BCRYPT_COST} \
        -e SECRETS_SYSTEM=${HYDRA_SECRETS_SYSTEM} \
        -e TTL_ACCESS_TOKEN=${HYDRA_TTL_ACCESS_TOKEN} \
        -e TTL_REFRESH_TOKEN=${HYDRA_TTL_REFRESH_TOKEN} \
        -e TTL_ID_TOKEN=${HYDRA_TTL_ID_TOKEN} \
        --entrypoint /bin/ash \
        ${HYDRA_IMAGE}:${HYDRA_IMAGE_TAG} \
        -c "\
            /usr/bin/hydra migrate sql --yes '${HYDRA_DSN}';\
            /usr/bin/hydra serve all \
            --dangerous-force-http \
            --dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-urls 'https://localhost'\
        "
```

OK so there's a LOT of environment variables there, but just ignore em for now
(if you ever do this you can actually
[look up what they do](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/reference/configuration)).

I've modified the `entrypoint` of the image because I want to do a few different
things before I run `hydra`:

- Run the SQL migrations
  - As you might expect from any reasonably written DB-adjacent program,
    migrations are idempotent
- Serve _both_ the public and admin API (`serve all`)
- Allow `hydra` to operate over unsecured HTTP on localhost
- Allow `hydra` to use insecure redirect URLs like HTTPS localhost (I actually
  don't need this but it's in the `Makefile` so I'll repeat it here)

BTW: Just to ruffle some feathers out there - if you think containerization
isn't a massively useful tool in 2022, you're wrong.

If you're with me at this point, you now have a working OAuth2+OpenID connect
compliant server - Done.

#### Create yourself an OAuth2+OpenID Connect client app

At this point we may have an OIDC compliant server, but we also need at least
_one_ client to make authentication requests to it!

You can do this quite easily by `docker exec`-ing into that container we started
earlier:

```makefile
hydra-local-create-client:
    $(DOCKER) exec -it \
        $(HYDRA_CONTAINER_NAME) \
        hydra clients create lwhn \
            --endpoint="$(HYDRA_ADMIN_ENDPOINT_URL)" \
            --callbacks="$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI)" \
            --id=$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_ID) \
            --secret=$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_SECRET) \
            --audience="$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_AUDIENCES)" \
            --post-logout-callbacks="$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI)" \
            --grant-types=authorization_code \
            --response-types=code \
            --scope=$(LWHN_HYDRA_CLIENT_SCOPES)
```

Hydra's got excellent
[documentation on the `hydra clients create` CLI](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/cli/hydra-clients-create).

#### Integrating Hydra into our app (and later other apps)

So we've got an OAuth2 provider running, with a single OAuth client... but we
haven't actually _written_ the app that we're going to use to manage or do
anything!

What were we trying to do again? It's a bit meta but try to stick with me -
**LoginWithHN (LWHN) has three similar but slightly different integration points
with Hydra:**

- Login implementation that Hydra depends on ("hydra calls this thing to
  actually do it's job")
- Demo app uses Hydra as a customer ("LWHN calls Hydra to actually do logins")
- Registration for _other client applications_ ("other peoples' apps use
  LoginWithHN to perform OAuth2 login")

Let's shelf this for now though, because we've hit on something we need to zoom
out and solve - **how do we actually authenticate people from HN?**

## Step three: Building the login mechanism

Let's zoom back out and build the actual login mechanism - that shouldn't be too
hard to hack right?

Since HN has public profile pages that users can modify at any time, we can
easily verify any user can access any account:

1. Get the user's username
2. Provide a unique code or phrase to put in their HN profile
3. Confirm the profile contains the expected text
4. Mark them as logged in

As many on HN helpfully noted, I'm
[not](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29929060)
[the](https://indieauth.com/)
[first](http://zacstewart.com/2012/12/24/verifying-minecraft-user-accounts.html)
to use this sort of method, it's been used to great effect in the past. The
method really boils down to one important `setInterval`:

<details>
  <summary> üìúÔ∏è Important setInterval #1, checking the HN Profil (click to expand)</summary>

```js
// Start watching for account
let times = 0
const intervalID = setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    // If we've exceeded max checks, then stop polling
    if (times >= maxChecks) {
      this.ongoingPolls.delete(hnUsername)
      clearInterval(intervalID)
      throw new Error(
        `Exceeded max checks [${maxChecks}] (delayMs: ${delayMs})`
      )
    }
    times++

    // Check user's YC profile
    this.logger.debug(
      `looking for [${displayToken}] on HN profile [${hnUsername}]`
    )

    // PREVIOUSLY:
    //
    // // FUTURE: if fallbacks get implemented, require that delay from ENV is no less than 30 seconds like before!
    // const resp = await axios.get(
    //   `https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=${hnUsername}`,
    //   {responseType: 'text'},
    // );
    //
    // const profileDataContainsCode = resp.data.includes(buildLoginTokenPhrase(displayToken));

    // Get user data using Firebase HN API
    const resp = await axios.get(
      `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/${hnUsername}.json`
    )

    const about = resp?.data?.about
    if (!about) {
      this.logger.error(
        'About unexpectedly missing on response from Firebase API'
      )
      return
    }

    // If the profile data contained the right info, then clear the interval and mark the account logged in
    if (!about.includes(buildLoginTokenPhrase(displayToken))) {
      return
    }

    // At this point we have found the display token, the user has confirmed usage of the account
    this.logger.debug(
      `found display token [${displayToken}] on HN profile [${hnUsername}]`
    )

    // Confirm login success
    await this.dbSvc.confirmLoginSuccessByHNUsername({
      hnUsername,
      hnMetadata: {
        karma: resp?.data?.karma,
        // created is expected to be unix epoch
        createdAtISOString: new Date(resp?.data?.created * 1000).toISOString()
      }
    })

    // Stop checking since it's been found
    this.ongoingPolls.delete(hnUsername)
    clearInterval(intervalID)
  } catch (err) {
    this.logger.error(
      `Error occurred while checking for HN profile page update: ${err.toString()}`
    )
  }
}, delayMs)
this.ongoingPolls.set(hnUsername, displayToken)
```

</details>

And that's basically it! you can imagine what `this.dbSvc` (in fact the
abstraction is a bit off there, that should be something like `loginSvc` (which
also exists!) but I digress.

## Hooking up to Hydra: Core functionality

OK, now we've got the basic functionality (well a sketch of it!) -- let's hook
it up to Hydra. Let's start by RTFMing:

- [Hydra docs on login flow](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/login)
- [Hydra docs on consent flow](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/consent)
- [Hydra example login & consent app in NodeJS](https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node/blob/master/src/routes/logout.ts)

Hydra's gone above and beyond in providing this documentation and example app,
so it's smart to use/study them.

**We need to create the source of truth for the Hydra OAuth2/OpenID Connect
facade**.

Out of this came a few NestJS controllers and endpoints that mediate the flow,
here's one example:

<details>
  <summary>üìúÔ∏è Login controller (click to expand)</summary>

```typescript
- POST /api/v1/login/start
- Start the login process for a given user
-
- @param {LoginStartRequest} body

That's what it looks like to _start_ the login flow. What I haven't included
here is the bit where I generate a `login_challenge` from Hydra but it's not
hard to do (you'll get one by just setting up Hydra correctly).

It's not quite clear from just that code but the `loginMechanism` that comes
back is an object like this:

```typescript
export enum LoginMechanismName {
  PollHN = 'poll-hn',
  TOTP = 'totp',
  Email = 'email'
}

export type HNUsername = string
export type PollHNLoginMechanism = {
  kind: LoginMechanismName.PollHN
  hnUsername: HNUsername
  displayToken: string
}

export type TOTPCode = number
export type TOTPLoginMechanism = {
  kind: LoginMechanismName.TOTP
  hnUsername: HNUsername
}

export type EmailAddress = string
export type EmailLoginMechanism = {
  kind: LoginMechanismName.Email
  hnUsername: HNUsername
}

export type LoginMechanism =
  | PollHNLoginMechanism
  | TOTPLoginMechanism
  | EmailLoginMechanism
```

Implementing the Hydra login and consent flows was easy, I'll avoid duplicating
their documentation with this post. Similarly, including HN-specific data like
karma count as OIDC claims was very easy during the Hydra integration.

LoginWithHN is obviously geared towards HN, but there are lots of other places
people might want to login using a similar flow. Who knows when I'll get to it,
but expansion is an interesting prospect.

## Hooking up to Hydra: LoginWithHN as the first (meta) client app

So now we've got the source of truth for Hydra in place, and we've got a
theoretically functional flow, let's build the app that exposes that flow for a
demo to anyone who visits! It's not hard to build, but paradoxically the more
interesting part is that there's another important `setInterval` - instead of
just `POST`ing username/password details to our app and being whisked away to
the OAuth2 server, we need to actually _wait_ for a message to come back. I've
kept it simple with some polling:

<details>
<summary>üìúÔ∏è The second important setInterval (click to expand)</summary>

```javascript
// Start polling to check for resolution of login
let intervalID = setInterval(() => {
  // Check whether the account has been confirmed using the display token
  fetch('/api/v1/hn/poll/status', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    credentials: 'same-origin',
    body: JSON.stringify({ displayToken })
  })
    .then((loginStartResp) =>
      processFetchJSONResponse({ response: loginStartResp })
    )
    .then((envelope) => processLoginResultData(envelope))
    .then((loggedIn) => {
      if (!loggedIn) {
        return
      }
      // If login succeeded, then we can stop polling
      // Next steps should have been triggered in processLoginResultData() and will be triggering soon
      if (indicatorElem) {
        indicatorElem.classList.add('hidden')
      }

      clearInterval(intervalID)
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      showPageFlash({
        variant: 'error',
        title: 'Error while checking login',
        description: `An error occurred while checking your profile... Please try <a href="/">logging in again</a>.`
      })

      if (indicatorElem) {
        indicatorElem.classList.remove('hidden')
      }

      clearInterval(intervalID)
    })
}, CHECK_HN_POLL_RESULT_INTERVAL_MS)

// You'll need this as well for context!

/**
 * Process the data fterp a login result, as
 * all login methods produce the same LoginResultData object
 *
 * @returns {boolean} whether the login completed or not
 */
function processLoginResultData(envelope) {
  // Ensure data is present
  if (!envelope.data) {
    const err = new Error('Data missing from envelope')
    err.responseData = envelope
    throw err
  }

  // Ensure request succeeded
  if (envelope.status !== 'success') {
    genericErrorFlash()
    console.error(err)
    const err = new Error('Login failed')
    err.responseData = envelope
    throw err
  }

  // Get the redirect URL
  const { confirmed, redirectURL } = envelope.data

  // Return immediately if the user is still not confirmed
  if (!confirmed) {
    return false
  }

  if (!redirectURL) {
    console.error(err)
    const err = new Error('redirectURL unexpectedly missing from response')
    err.responseData = envelope
    throw err
  }

  // Show flash signalling successful login
  showPageFlash({
    variant: 'success',
    title: 'Login successful',
    description: "You've been logged in! Redirecting...",
    flashDurationMs: DEFAULT_FLASH_DURATION_MS
  })

  // If the response succeeded, then the login cookie has been set,
  // we can go to the page to finish out the login
  setTimeout(
    () => (window.location = redirectURL),
    LOGIN_SUCCESS_REDIRECT_WAIT_MS
  )

  return true
}
```

</details>

This time I'm checking in with the core functionality API to check whether the
`setInterval` from earlier has resolved itself.

If the user _has_ logged in properly we show a little message and use
`window.location` redirect to the URL that you'd be redirectedto normally by
`POST`ing your username/password.

And that's all it really takes! Of course I'm missing
[the rest of the owl](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl), but
just believe me here -- it's not that hard (you could do it yourself, probably
in a day).

## Hooking up to Hydra: Setting up LWHN to onboard other client apps

To make this tool actually useful to _anyone else_, we're going to have to
enable other client apps to do login with HN _as well_. This is basically as
simple as interacting with the
[private Hydra administrative API](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/reference/api/#tag/admin)
and creating clients when people sign up. Rather than dropping more code, I'll
show the app I built to make it happen which was quite fun to build:

![top of the LWHN app](/media/lwhn-top-picture.png)

And below there, an example integration and some instructions for various ways
to integrate

![integration instructions below the fold of the LWHN app](/media/lwhn-integration-picture.png)

# Easy addon #1: Getting the user's karma

One repeatedly requested feature was the ability to limit users based on HN
karma.

Since it's pretty fraught for _me_ to determine where the limit should be, I
just expose it.

It was quite easy to do, since
[the official HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) produces user `karma`
information:

```typescript
          // Confirm login success
          await this.dbSvc.confirmLoginSuccessByHNUsername({
            hnUsername,
            hnMetadata: {
              karma: resp?.data?.karma,
              // created is expected to be unix epoch
              createdAtISOString: new Date(resp?.data?.created * 1000).toISOString(),
            },
          });
```

You've seen this code before (it's in the larger code listing above) but worth
noting -- I just save it in the DB next to everything else when I confirm a
successful login.

## Next: Getting whether a HN user is a YC founder or not

Though they're related, [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) is not
[Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com). Not every HN user is a YC founder, and
one thing people have asked for a lot is **being able to prove whether an HN
user is indeed a YC founder**. YC founders want to make things for YC founders
(who they can get lightning-fast feedback from, etc), and maybe even some people
who aren't YC founders want to make things for YC founders.

Thanks to the help of [OrangeDAO](https://badge.orangedao.xyz/) (which was
recently
[covered by TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/hundreds-of-y-combinator-alumni-join-crypto-collective-to-back-web3-startups/)),
it's actually quite easy to build in the functionality.

Stay tuned for when that drops (or don't -- just go register now for an
application and I'll email you!).

## Wrapup

There's more to do, but that's it for today! For those following along at home,
if you were writing code you'd have already succesfully built the functionality
that makes LoginWithHN tick.

Thanks for coming along on this ride -- This project took a lot longer than it
had to, but I'm glad to finally have it out there, and look forward to using it
in my own projects. Building things for the HN community is always a joy, an
hopefully now other people will have an option for getting auth hooked up that
is extremely quick and easy to use.
