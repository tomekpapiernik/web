## OAuth2.0 service coming to Ory Cloud

We have been making good progress towards Ory Hydra 2.0. While a major version, we intend to keep all APIs with as few breaking changes as possible. The efforts focus on some long-standing issues in the persistence layer. In particular, data growth rate and performance improvements are the focus areas! If you are interested to see what is going on, check out PR [#2796](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/2796).

And Ory Hydra 2.0 will be available as an API in Ory Cloud! If you are interested in Ory Cloud, apply to [Ory Acceleration Program](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1KWJxgKzNQWOjR9r5blC41wextgn) and receive a **one-year free subscription for Ory Cloud's Start-Up plan**. The Start-Up plan comes with convenient features such as custom domains and unlimited identities/tokens!

More on timelines and Ory Hydra 2.0 plans will follow later this year.

### Ory Hydra 1.11.0 released 🎉

A massive release powered by you - the Ory Community .

#### Support for Hardware Security Models

Ory Hydra now supports loading Private and Public Keys from Hardware Security Modules, a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions. Thank you [@aarmam](https://github.com/aarmam) for this amazing work! For more information, please [read the guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/hsm-support).

#### OIDC/OAuth2.0 Dynamic Client Registration

Next up, Ory Hydra now natively supports the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration and OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol which can be enabled (optionally) in the configuration! Thank you [@fjvierap](https://github.com/fjvierap) for your hard work!

#### JWT Profile for OAuth2.0 Grants (RFC7523)

We do not stop there, [@Xopek](https://github.com/Xopek) and [@jagobagascon](https://github.com/jagobagascon) added the Support for JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants (RFC7523) to Ory Hydra! This major improvement allows Ory Hydra to have an even better integration API than before!

#### Support for ARM64 (Apple M1, FreeBSD, Linux ARM)

For our Apple users and everyone eyeballing ARM64, we now distributed binaries and Docker Images for all platforms and CPU architectures, including Apple M1, Linux ARM (v6, v7, v8, ARM64), and - this is new - FreeBSD!

Lastly, we resolved a bug in the configuration loading which now allows loading complex configuration keys from environment variables without hassle!
