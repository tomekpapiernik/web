A new year starts and we have been making good progress towards Ory Hydra 2.0.
This means OAuth2.0 and OIDC APIs will soon be available Ory Cloud.

## OAuth2.0 service coming to Ory Cloud

While Ory Hydra 2.0 is a major version update, there will be a very low number
of breaking changes. The update will particularly improve performance and manage
data growth rates for huge workloads.  
For a deep dive into the Ory Hydra 2.0 code visit PR
[#2796](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/2796).

### New Features in Ory Hydra 1.11.0 🎉

A massive release powered by you - the Ory Community .

#### Support for Hardware Security Models

Ory Hydra now lets you load public and private keys from a Hardware Security
Module (HSM). An HSM is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages
digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital
signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions. Thank you
[@aarmam](https://github.com/aarmam) for this amazing work! For more
information, please
[read the guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/hsm-support).

#### OIDC/OAuth2.0 Dynamic Client Registration

Ory Hydra now natively supports the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
and OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol. This optional capability can be
enabled in the configuration. Thank you [@fjvierap](https://github.com/fjvierap)
for your hard work!

#### JWT Profile for OAuth2.0 Grants (RFC7523)

Ory Hydra now supports an improved integration API for JSON Web Token (JWT)
profile for OAuth 2.0 authorization grants. This improved API makes it easier to
integrate a variety of devices and applications into Ory Hydra. Many thanks to
[@Xopek](https://github.com/Xopek) and
[@jagobagascon](https://github.com/jagobagascon) for this contribution!

#### Support for ARM64 (Apple M1, FreeBSD, Linux ARM)

We now distribute binaries and Docker images for all platforms and CPU
architectures, including Apple M1 (ARMv6), ARMv7, ARMv8, Linux (ARM6, ARM7,
ARM8) and a new platform: FreeBSD.

Lastly, we resolved a bug in the configuration loading which now allows loading
complex configuration keys from environment variables without hassle!
