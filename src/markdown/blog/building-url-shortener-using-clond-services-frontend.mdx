The previous blog post covers the implementation of the backend for the showcase using Ory and Supabase. This article will show you an example of building a front-end part for the URL shortener.

## What technologies do we use

[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) An open source framework making web development simple and powerful. Build your next Vue.js application with confidence using Nuxt.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

I started building JS apps in 2013. It was fun building apps using backbone, underscore, and jquery back in those days. In late 2015 I decided to switch to backend development, and I abandoned coding in JS. The best thing for me was to be subscribed to front-end newsletters like front-end focus or similar and have conversations with front-end engineers to be informed about current trends. It helped me be on track and have at least knowledge of what to use and when.
I loved that JS started to move to ES6 implementation because coding in ES5 looks like a nightmare. Webcomponents/Polymer/Material design and other stuff were awesome inventions.
